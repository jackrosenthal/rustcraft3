# Reverse-engineering notes

Findings from the 1.27b binaries (`game.dll` SHA-256 d51e5680…8236, `war3.exe`,
`Storm.dll`) that the port relies on.  Addresses are virtual addresses in the
original images.

## Startup and data

- **Command line** (war3.exe, Storm argument table at `0x45d090`): `-d3d`, `-opengl`,
  `-swtnl`, `-classic`, `-crash`, `-datadir <v>`, `-loadfile <v>`, `-gametype <v>`,
  `-fullscreen`, `-window`.
- **Archive priorities** (`FUN_6f03df20`): `War3.mpq` 0, `War3x.mpq` 1,
  `War3xLocal.mpq` 3, `War3Patch.mpq` 8.  Both base archives are always mounted.
- **Data sets** (`FUN_6f03e070`): the folder `Melee_V<n>` or `Custom_V<n>` inside
  War3x, War3xLocal, and War3Patch (twice) is mounted at priorities 9–12 via Storm
  ordinal 300 (`SFileOpenPathAsArchive`).  `n` is the game version
  (`DAT_6fcd52f0`): 0 under `-classic` or for a RoC replay (`FUN_6f046800`), else 1.
- **MPQ Huffman** (Storm `FUN_15015410` and helpers): weight tables at
  `0x150421b8`, 9 × 0x102 bytes; adaptive updates only for compression type 0.

## Scripts

- Native registration: `FUN_6f207490` (common.j, 1,167 entries:
  `push sig; mov edx,name; mov ecx,impl; call 0x6f90d120`) and `FUN_6f9bdec0`
  (common.ai, 124 entries).  Natives are cdecl; reals are passed by pointer.
- Order ids: `FUN_6f487cb0` registers 347 `(id, name)` pairs; `smart` (851971) is the
  constant at `0x6fb77ddc`.
- RNG: state update `FUN_6f1b7130`, seeding `FUN_6f1cc4e0`, table at `0x6fa92f10`.
  `GetRandomInt` (`0x6f201e30`) returns `lo + rand*(|hi-lo|+1)>>32`, which exceeds
  `lo` when `hi < lo`.
- `StringHash` is Storm ordinal 590: Jenkins lookup2 over the upper-cased string with
  `/` mapped to `\`.
- `R2S` formats with 3 decimals; `S2I` is `atoi`.
- Invalid-player defaults: `GetPlayerController` → 5, `GetPlayerRace` → 1.
- `GetCameraMargin` reads `UI\MiscData.txt [CameraMargins]` × 128.

## Rendering

- Cliff models: `Doodads\Terrain\<dir>\<dir><TL><TR><BR><BL><var>.mdx`, letters
  `'A' + layer - min` (`FUN_6f744560`).
- Day/night: first light of the DNC model; frame = time of day × sequence length;
  direction = light node rotation × −Z; colors are stored BGR.
- `war3map.shd`: one byte per 32×32 cell, rows from the north edge.
- Projection, measured against frames captured from the original at 4:3: the
  vertical extent matches 70° across the 4:3 diagonal, and the camera target projects
  0.085 NDC above center.  Not yet confirmed in code.
- CGameUI (`0x6f367710`): world frame from y 0.13 to 0.58; `ResourceBarFrame`
  TOPRIGHT; `UpperButtonBarFrame` TOPLEFT.  `FUN_6f111600` is SetPoint
  (frame, point, relative, relativePoint, x, y), points in TOPLEFT…BOTTOMRIGHT order.
- Player gold is stored in tenths internally (`CInfoPanelIconAlly::vf27`).

## Tooling

The decompilation is produced by headless Ghidra 12.1.2 with MSVC RTTI applied,
virtual methods named `Class::vfN`, native implementations named `jass_<Name>` and
`ai_<Name>`, and the Decompiler Parameter ID analyzer enabled.  Reference frames are
captured by running the original under Wine on a private Xvfb display.
